This program was allocated time in the Gemini "Poor Weather Queue".
This is shown as band 4 in the Observing Tool.

Poor Weather Queue programs are executed under poor conditions when
nothing in the regular science queue can be done.  There is no implicit
or explicit guarantee that data will be taken.  Time spent on programs in
the poor weather queue is not charged to the PI or the partner.

This program was originally submitted as a joint proposal, however, since
the time used is not charged to any partners, it is not necessary to track
the original joint partner contributions.

The PI, $values.piName, will receive a notification email from Gemini with
instructions for retrieving the "Phase II skeleton" and completing the
Phase II definitions.  The Primary and Additional Support Contact information
for this program will be included in that email. THE DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING
THE PHASE II IS JANUARY 17 2020.
