The PI, @PI_NAME@, will receive a notification email from Gemini with instructions for retrieving the "Phase II skeleton" and completing the Phase II definitions. The Primary and Additional Support Contact information for this program will be included in that email. THE DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING THE PHASE II IS JANUARY 17 2020.
